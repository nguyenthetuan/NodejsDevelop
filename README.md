# Login App

The idea is that you can download this project to use and adapt it for any project in node.js.

## Instalation

npm run dev

## Usage

If you want to add new routes, create your file in the routes folder, there, you just can write your endpoints. Nevertheless if you want functionality create a new controller file (like **controllers/user.js**) then import all the functions in your routes file. And of course you can modified the User model.
I leave a public folder for future projects, in this repo is empty with three folders.

To change the index title, go to: **routes/index.js** and change the title value.
